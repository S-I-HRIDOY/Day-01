<span>Introduction
    In recent years, full stack web development has gained popularity in the tech industry. It asks candidates to possess the know-how of the entire app development process, including front-end and back-end. Additionally, they need strong analytical and problem-solving skills along with an awareness of the latest web development trends to stay competitive.
    
    So, in this blog, you will learn what full stack web development is and what types of skills are required to build a career in this domain. 
    
    Understanding Full Stack Web Development
    Full stack web development is all about developing both the front-end and back-end of apps from a single source. So, a single developer or a team of developers will be responsible for the job, not two separate teams working on both parts.
    
    The front-end refers to that part of an application through which users directly interact and take action, such as the user interface (UI). To build this part, developers need UI/UX designing skills. The front-end is often called client side. In contrast, the back-end is all about a system’s database, server, and logical part, which works behind the front-end part. Users have no scope to interact directly with the back-end part of an app. This back-end part is often called the server side. For this part, developers need coding, database management, testing, and allied skills. 
    
    So, full stack developers need all the knowledge of UI development, coding, database management, testing, and other essential skills. In this way, they can build an entire application and ensure its feasibility cohesively to handle the full stack web development workflows.
    
    Advantages of Full Stack Development
    Full stack web developers are well known for their development speed. They can efficiently handle both front-end and back-end development simultaneously. They conduct their tasks without any dependency on separate front-end or back-end developers, so they swiftly create a product without any time delay.
    Hiring full stack developers is a cost-effective solution for organisations. As they know about handling both the front-end and back-end systems, they can work independently and build an entire project. So, instead of hiring front-end and back-end developers, they prefer full stack developers. Thus, organisations can run with their budget estimation by hiring them.
    Full stack web development requires developers to be updated with advanced technologies. So, they are well-versed in responsive web design, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and blockchain technologies. Thus, they can integrate new features in the existing version of software and update it well. Also, they can design the structure of mobile apps. They even collaborate and help the UI/UX team.

    Tech Stacks for Full Stack Web Development
    Here are the important tech stacks for full stack web development –
    
    MERN
    MERN is a popular stack for full stack web development which is composed of React, Node.js, Expres.js, and MongoDB. Its major feature is the React library. This library is well known for its outstanding capability of simplifying and managing UI and improving overall site performance. Apart from React integration, it has features like coding on servers and browsers simultaneously. 
    
    MEAN
    MEAN stack uses technologies like Angular, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express.js to simplify the development and testing tasks. Amongst these, Angular provides all-in-one solutions that help developers overcome challenges during single-page application building for full stack web development. Another benefit of this stack is you don’t need to learn multiple programming languages to use it. Only you need to work with JavaScript.
    
    LAMP
    LAMP stack is built with Apache, Linux, PHP, and MySQL. It’s an open-source full stack web development stack that is popular for its flexibility and simplicity. Over the years, WordPress and Shopify have used this stack. It’s popular amongst web developers because of its customisable and cost-effective solutions. As a result, it improves the performance of apps and websites.
    
    PERN
    PERN has the same composition as the MERN stack. However, the major difference is that the PERN stack uses PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB. PostgreSQL is SQL-based and enterprise-level and has strict rules of ACID compliance and data integrity, which ensure data validity. Additionally, this database relies on monolithic architecture to provide reliable storage and ensure the elements are working systematically. Thus, developers prefer PostgreSQL over MongoDB. That is the reason for the popularity of the PERN stack.
    
    Serverless Stack
    The major difference between serverless stack and other stacks is that serverless stack depends on cloud infrastructure instead of the local server. This cloud platform reduces the burden of infrastructure management because it maintains the server and updates the security by itself. So, developers can write and execute codes through this stack without concern or infrastructure. 
    
    Workflow for Full Stack Development
    The full stack web development comprises these 5 stages – 
    
    Planning and designing phase
    For full stack web development, it is crucial to know the requirements and understand the scope of the project. Developers also need to collaborate and coordinate with stakeholders to identify the desired technical specifications and features. 
    
    Front-end development
    After the planning and designing phase, front-end development starts. In this stage, developers configure their project structure and layout. So, they need to choose the right technologies, such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS frameworks. Additionally, frameworks like Angular, React, and others help them develop UI while ensuring accessibility and responsiveness. 
    
    Back-end development
    The next step of full stack web development is back-end development. In this stage, developers build and integrate the back-end part of the project. For this, they need to work with server-side logic, handle data management tasks, and create RESTful APIs. So, they choose a server-side language like Python and Ruby. They also design database schemas with the help of DB management systems like MySQL and PostgreSQL. They perform these tasks to ensure the security and flexibility of the back-end system.
    
    Integration and testing
    In this stage, full stack developers connect the front-end and back-end components. That means they integrate the components to establish communication between them. It ensures smooth data flow and feasibility between the client side and the server side. 
    
    Then, they plan and execute testing. They conduct unit, integration, and end-to-end testing to achieve the desired functionality and behaviour of the entire application.
    
    Deployment and maintenance
    After completing the development and testing phase, developers start the application deployment. So, they set the application for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) to ensure the production of the application.
    
    After the deployment, they also monitor the performance of the app and identify if there is any issue. Side by side, they conduct maintenance of the application to ensure a smooth experience for users.
    
    Career Path of a Full Stack Developer
    First, you need to earn a four-year bachelor’s degree in any of these popular disciplines – computer science, information technology (IT), computer engineering, or other related fields.
    Then, apply for an internship in full stack web development. It will help you extend the networking opportunity and lead you towards future job offers. 
    Side by side, you have to continue your self-study of new programming languages. It will assist you to land an opportunity to work on development. Additionally, you can take a certification course if you want to.
    Next, you can work on volunteer projects. This is a good option for gaining experience as a fresher.
    Then, apply for an entry-level position. Entry-level full stack developers are responsible for building front- and back-end structures. They also coordinate with other professionals to design and test codes.
    After that, you will move to a senior full-stack developer role. These roles require expertise in managing organisational infrastructure and a solid understanding of architectural design and database management.
    After spending some years in this role, you will move to a managerial role. This role is all about handling management-level tasks. Side by side, you have to spend time on coding and problem-solving.
